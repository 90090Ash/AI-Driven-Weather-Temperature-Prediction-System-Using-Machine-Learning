# AI-Driven-Weather-Temperature-Prediction-System-Using-Machine-Learning
This project is an AI-powered weather forecasting application that predicts temperature using machine learning techniques. The system is trained on historical Indian weather data and uses a Random Forest Regression model to analyze patterns between humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure
